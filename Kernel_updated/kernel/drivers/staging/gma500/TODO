-	Sort out the power management side. Not important for Poulsbo but
	matters for Moorestown/Medfield
-	Debug Oaktrail/Moorestown support (single pipe, no BIOS on mrst,
					some other differences)
-	Add 2D acceleration via console and DRM
-	Add scrolling acceleration using the GTT to do remapping on the main
	framebuffer.
-	HDMI testing
-	Oaktrail HDMI and other features
-	Oaktrail MIPI
-	Medfield needs a lot of further love

As per kernel policy and the in the interest of the safety of various
kittens there is no support or plans to add hooks for the closed user space
stuff.

ToDo list (incomplete, unordered)
	- convert mouse, keyboard, and power to platform devices
	- add copyright / driver author / license
	- add compile as module support
	- move nvec devices to mfd cells?
	- adjust to kernel style
	- fix clk usage
	  should not be using clk_get_sys(), but clk_get(&pdev->dev, conn)
	  where conn is either NULL if the device only has one clock, or
	  the device specific name if it has multiple clocks.
